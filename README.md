# MMjoy project English mirror[wip]

The original repo of mmjoy_en has been archived and quite outdated. Heres an updated version as the newer infos are quite scattered in the forum.

To start with MMJoy2 proceed to [the updated wiki](https://github.com/gordonhch/mmjoy_en/wiki).

In order to download the firmware and software archive, please go to [This translated page of the project](https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&sl=ru&tl=en&u=https%3A%2F%2Fsites.google.com%2Fsite%2Fmmjoyproject%2Ffajly-dla-skacivania&sandbox=1). The two currently recommended versions to use with is [v20151118] and [v20160818upd1].
